# Background

I am interested in algorithm and software development and my current research focuses on analyzing next-generation 
sequencing data including short-read mapping and genetic variation detection. Before I joined Dr. Marth’s lab as a 
bioinformatics researcher, I pursued my Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2009 and my 
masters degree in Computer Science from National Sun Yat-sen University in 2004. In 2008 I spent a year as a visiting 
scholar in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

I got an MSci in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge (UK), then an MS and PhD in Physics from BC. 
The focus of my PhD research was the study and calculation of the thermal conductivity in semiconductor materials. 
I worked from an agency of the Ministry of Defense (UK) for three years prior to moving to the US. I've been in the 
Marthlab for nearly 4 years and my work here focuses on the development of next-generation sequencing pipelines.
