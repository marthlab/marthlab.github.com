# Research

My primary research interests center around genetic variations: how to discover genetic polymorphisms, what these variations tell us about human pre-history, and how can we use them as markers to track disease. My lab develops computer software tools that allow us and other researchers to answer these questions. We are also working on software tools to analyze the ouput of new, super-high throughput sequencing machines that promise to revolutionarize de novo sequencing and medical resequencing projects.
