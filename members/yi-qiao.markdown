I am interested in algorithm and software development and my current research focuses on analyzing next-generation 
sequencing data including short-read mapping and genetic variation detection. Before I joined Dr. Marthâ€™s lab as a 
bioinformatics researcher, I pursued my Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2009 and my 
masters degree in Computer Science from National Sun Yat-sen University in 2004. In 2008 I spent a year as a visiting 
scholar in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
