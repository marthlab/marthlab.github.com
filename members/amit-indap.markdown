# Background

I graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. I have a 
Master's degree from a joint program in Bioinformatics from the Medical College of Wisconsin and Marquette University. 
Prior to my arrival here I worked at Cornell University with Carlos Bustamante.

I'm interested in studying human genetic variation from an evolutionary perspective and how this relates to complex 
traits and disease. I've written and contributed analyses to several publications in the areas of 
population/evolutionary genomics, human genetics, and bioinformatics. Currently, I am implementing a variant caller 
for family based sequencing studies using Bayesian Networks.

I got an MSci in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge (UK), then an MS and PhD in Physics from BC. 
The focus of my PhD research was the study and calculation of the thermal conductivity in semiconductor materials. 
I worked from an agency of the Ministry of Defense (UK) for three years prior to moving to the US. I've been in the 
Marthlab for nearly 4 years and my work here focuses on the development of next-generation sequencing pipelines.
