# Background

I joined the lab in February 2010. My current focus is support of the NCBI variant calling processing pipeline for the 
1000 Genomes project. I am personally interested in all aspects of genomic observation and variation.

Since joining I have specifically focused on developing adapting the lab's core variant detection algorithm (GigaBayes)
to non-uniform copy number and abstractly-defined alleles. The result of this work is FreeBayes, a variant detection 
system which combines these algorithmic developments with substantial performance enhancements.

In addition to this work I support the lab as a programmer and technical associate in a number of related bioinformatics
software projects:

fastahack - utilities for indexing and sequence extraction from FASTA files
vcflib - a C++ library for parsing and manipulating VCF files.
phred.py - phred score manipulation in python
jvcf - Joint Variant Call Format -- JSON notation for genetic variant annotation
multichoose - C++ library containing a generic function to generate multiset combinations (n multichoose k) from vectors of any type.
parallelizer - scripts to simplify trivial parallelization of data processing software
fasta-utilities - python scripts for FASTA file manipulation.
A full list of my public repositories can be found on my user page on github.
